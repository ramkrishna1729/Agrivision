# Agrivision: IoT and AI-based Smart Agriculture

## Introduction
Agrivision is an innovative smart agriculture system that integrates IoT (Internet of Things) and AI (Artificial Intelligence) technologies to optimize agricultural practices. By leveraging real-time data monitoring and predictive analytics, Agrivision enhances crop growth and resource utilization, leading to improved yields and efficient water management.

## Key Features
1. **Automatic Water Irrigation**: The system automatically irrigates crops based on soil moisture levels, ensuring optimal hydration and minimizing water wastage.
2. **Real-time Data Upload**: Agrivision uploads real-time environmental data , including temperature, humidity, light intensity, and soil moisture, to the ThingSpeak IoT cloud. This data is also displayed on an LCD screen for easy monitoring.
3. **Global Control via Virtual Switch and Real time notofication **: Using the Blynk IoT platform, Agrivision provides global control over the water pump and artificial light . Farmers can remotely toggle these devices on or off via virtual switches on their mobile devices and notifications through related to the data .
4. **Machine Learning-based Plant Stress Prediction**: Agrivision employs machine learning models to predict plant stress levels based on the ideal environmental parameters. This allows farmers to take proactive measures to mitigate stress and optimize crop health.
5. **CNN-based Plant Disease Detection**: Agrivision utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for plant disease detection. By analyzing images of plant leaves, the system can identify and diagnose diseases early, enabling timely intervention and disease management.
